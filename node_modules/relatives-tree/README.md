# relatives-tree

A tiny library (~3.3kb gz) for calculating specific JSON data to family tree nodes and connectors.

🖥 [Here is a demo](https://sanichkotikov.github.io/react-family-tree-example/) app with React rendering.

```js
import relativesTree from 'relatives-tree';
const data = relativesTree(jsonData, rootId);
```

The nodes & the connectors are simple JS objects, so you can use any rendering layer.
