1 CONC brought up by an uncle. Worked for a time in an off-licence, that he had 
1 CONC been ordained for the church, but had not been inducted to a living, and, 
1 CONC what is certain, he went to business college in West Nile St, Glasgow. 
1 CONC There, before 1906, he was teaching in the college. In 1906, he left 
1 CONC Glasgow and arrived in Nottingham where he set up a business college of 
1 CONC his own, and two years later, he set up another in Mansfield. After 
1 CONC Mother and Father were married, he expanded his activities and I have

1 CONT my mother's very much younger sister was the maverick. The only blonde 
1 CONC sister, reputedly very attractive - though she was thoroughly spoilt. I 
1 CONC know nothing of her early years, but in her 30s, she became a very 
1 CONC successful ladies hairdresser in Nottingham, controlling at one time 6 
1 CONC shops. Family gossip, as I remember it, was that she spent money like 
1 CONC water, and one story has her buying a red 'costume' and then buying a red 
1 CONC sports car to go with it.  By the late 30s, and after her daughter Pat 
1 CONC had been born, there was a collapse of her business interests. From a 
1 CONC relatively high standard of living - dinner parties, weekends in hotels, 
1 CONC etc - her life became very humdrum and she constantly moaned about it. 
1 CONC She had married Frank Jones, a shop assistant in a gardening shop - and 
1 CONC he was a 'gentleman'.

1 CONC Derick's notes:
1 CONT Pat seemed to have one ambition in 1939-45 was - to marry an American 
1 CONC serviceman. And eventually she did, but not before she had first married 
1 CONC a contemporary of mine (I had joined the navy on the same day) Ron 
1 CONC Miller. The marriage went on the rocks very rapidly - and she met and 
1 CONC married Bill - an American- and they had a daughter, Lorraine. They soon 
1 CONC afterwards went to the States and another child, Matthew, was born Pat 
1 CONC left Bill and eventually married again. Her life cannot have been very 
1 CONC happy and I believe she died an alcoholic.
